# Naive-Bayes-Text-Classification

In this projectI have implemented Bayes and Logistic Regression for text classification.

The data set is divided into two sets: training set and test set. Each set has two directories: spam and ham. All files in the spam folders are spam messages and all files in the ham folder are legitimate (non spam) messages.
I have made an effort to implement the algorithm described in http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/pdf/13bayes.pdf, MCAP Logistic Regression algorithm with L2 regularization for different values of Î». 
I have also improved the Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression algorithms by throwing away (i.e., filtering out) stop words such as \the" \of" and \for" from all the documents.
